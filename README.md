## PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
* Goal: Reconstruct human speech from neural signal

* Data Source: Data is from an experiment that clinical doctor electro-nodes in a subjectâ€™s cortical surface and subject listens to 2100 human reading sentences. At the same time, recording audio signal and neural signal. 

* Project Link: https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/rice-stat-640-444-2016

## IDEA: 
* Basic idea: From neural network: A good neural network model is the one has the modeling structure to extract the important features from data
* Background knowledge: In neural science, different frequency signal is from different depth of brain and the information used to reconstruct audio signal can be linear or non-linear. The same for different electronodes.
* Idea: Two layers modeling
	First Layer: Apply different models, linear or non-linear, to different frequencies and locations and select the optimal one to make the prediction which is the input for the second layer
	Second Layer: Apply different models to the result from the first layer and make the final prediction
* Advantage:
  * Model structure illustrates deep insight from the domain, neural science, knowledge
  * Can be used for distributed computating, becaused of the by step computation

* Model idea visualization

## METHOD: 
1. Split data into two categories activated or inhabitated(based on neural activity) with Hidden Markov Model
2. First layer: Create new variables by extracting feature from each frequency(6) band and location(70), 
3. Second Layer: Make Final prediction based on 76 new variables from the first layer
